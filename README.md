# SoupMS
SoupMS is a server emulator for Global MapleStory (GMS) version 83. this is forked from CosmicMS.

## Introduction

This is a personal project to create a fun single player experience. I am planning on making changes to quests and PQs to be solo. I don't really expect anyone to ever read this lol but I have a decent amount of freetime and professionally use SQL and code.

### Goals
What I am working towards.
* __Vanilla like experience__ - keep gameplay similar to vanilla
* __Custom partybquests__ - update PQs to be singleplayer
* __Custom client files__ - planning on updating specifically I/L wizard to have better damage and buff magic attack to be competitive against weapon attack.

### Non-goals
Explicitly excluded from the scope of the project.
* __Public server__ - there will not be a released server because I don't plan on dealing with that stuff as I don't like multi-player games anymore.
